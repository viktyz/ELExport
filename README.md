`ELExport` is an easy and safe way to export log file. Using `ELog` instead of `NSLog` you can get more information from log file in disk.

## How To Get Started

- [Download ELExport](https://github.com/viktyz/ELExport.git) and try out the included iOS example project `ELog.xcodeproj`.
- Also you can try test cases in `ELogTests.m` and `ELogInstanceTests.m` to learn how to use the methods in `ELExport.h` .

## Communication

- If you'd like to **ask a general question**, send email to [66745628@qq.com](66745628@qq.com).
- If you **found a bug**, _and can provide steps to reliably reproduce it_, open an issue.
- If you **have a feature request**, open an issue.
- If you **want to contribute**, submit a pull request.

## Installation

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like ELExport in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is required to build ELExport 0.0.3.

#### Podfile

To integrate ELExport into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '7.0'

target 'TargetName' do
pod 'ELExport', '~> 0.0.3'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Installation with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate ELExport into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "viktyz/ELExport" ~> 0.0.3
```

Run `carthage` to build the framework and drag the built `ELExport.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Architecture

- `ELEFile`
- `ELExport`

## Usage

After import `ELExport.h` in the code file where you want to export log to file in disk, just try to replace `NSLog` with `ELog`.
Then all the logs will saved to file in disk automaticly in the right time and safe way.

## Known issues

Any important log record, be sure to use `[[ELExport sharedExport] synchronize]` to keep it in sync.
